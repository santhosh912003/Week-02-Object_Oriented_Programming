## Overview

Week 2 was dedicated to mastering core OOP principles using Java. We covered how to design modular, reusable code using classes and objects, and explored deeper concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. Understanding these principles is crucial for writing clean, scalable, and maintainable Java applications.
